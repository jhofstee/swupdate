config UBIVOL
	bool "ubivol"
	default n
	depends on HAVE_LIBUBI
	depends on MTD
	help
	  ubi is the default format for NAND device.
	  Say Y if you have NAND or you use UBI on
	  your system.

comment "ubivol support needs libubi"
	depends on !HAVE_LIBUBI

config UBIBLACKLIST
	string "List of MTD devices to be excluded for UBI"
	depends on UBIVOL
	help
	  Define a list of MTD devices that are excluded
	  by scan_mtd_device. The devices are still available
	  as raw devices.
	  The list can be set as a string with the mtd numbers.
	  Examples: "0 1 2"
	  This excludes mtd0-mtd1-mtd2 to be searched for UBI volumes

config UBIVIDOFFSET
	int "VID Header Offset"
	depends on UBIVOL
	default 0
	help
	  Force UBI to set a VID header offset to be 2048 bytes
	  instead of the value reported by the kernel.
	  In other words, you may ask UBI to avoid using sub-pages.
	  This is not recommended since this will require
	  more storage overhead, but may be useful
	  if your NAND driver incorrectly reports that it can handle
	  sub-page accesses when it should not.


config CFI
	bool "cfi"
	depends on MTD
	default n
	help
	  Handler to store images in flash in raw mode,
	  without UBI

config CFIHAMMING1
	bool "cfi (1bit Hamming)"
	depends on MTD
	default n
	help
	  Handler to store images in flash in raw mode, with 1bit hamming
	  OOB instead of the algoritm used. E.g. Useful on certain omaps
	  to store SPL in the regions where the ROMcode tries to load from.
	  (assumes sector size of 512 and page size of 2048)

config RAW
	bool "raw"
	default n
	help
	  This is a simple handler that simply copies
	  into the destination.

config LUASCRIPTHANDLER
	bool "luascript"
	depends on LUA
	default n
	help
	  Handler to be called for pre- and post scripts
	  written in LUA.

config SHELLSCRIPTHANDLER
	bool "shellscript"
	default n
	help
	  Handler to be called for pre- and post scripts
	  written as shell scripts. The default shell /bin/sh
	  is called.

config HANDLER_IN_LUA
	bool "Handlers in LUA"
	depends on LUASCRIPTHANDLER
	default n
	help
	  Allow to write own handlers in LUA.
	  They are loaded at the start-up.

config ARCHIVE
	bool "archive"
	depends on HAVE_LIBARCHIVE
	default n
	help
	  Handler using the libarchive to extract tarballs
	  into a filesystem.

config UBOOT
	bool "uboot"
	depends on HAVE_ZLIB
	default n
	help
	  Enable it to change U-Boot environment
	  during the installation process.

comment "uboot support needs libz"
	depends on !HAVE_ZLIB

config UBOOT_FWENV
	string "U-Boot Environment Configuration file"
	depends on UBOOT
	default "/etc/fw_env.config"
	help
	  This is the file described in U-Boot documentation
	  in the tools directory. It tells to the user space
	  where U-Boot environment is saved, that is, on which
	  MTD device.

config UBOOT_LIBRARY
	bool "Use U-Boot library to access the environment"
	depends on UBOOT
	default n
	help
	  Just U-Boot knows how to access the environment. swupdate
	  imported code for this with the fw_env.c file, but it is not
	  synchronized with U-Boot. If a library is exported by U-Boot, it is
	  possible to use it instead of this legacy code.
